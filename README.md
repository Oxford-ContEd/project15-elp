# Gunshot Detection in Tropical African Forests
### University of Oxford - Project 15 - Elephant Listening Project

## Introduction

This project is a group exercise undertaken as part of the University of Oxford - Artificial Intelligence: Cloud and Edge Implementations course, as a learning challenge from Microsoft and Elephant Listening Project. The objective is to devise solutions against illegal elephant hunting in tropical African forests by enabling sensors for instant prediction of gunshot events and thus mitigate poaching attempts.

## Quick Start

- Deploy the Project 15 platform as per instructions here https://microsoft.github.io/project15/Deploy/Deployment.html

- Add a device called `gunshot-detector-1` as per the instructiones here https://microsoft.github.io/project15/Deploy/ConnectingDevice.html

* Run the client simulation to send telemetry data to IoT Hub
