# Gunshot Detection in Tropical African Forests
### University of Oxford - Project 15 - Elephant Listening Project

## Introduction

This project is a group exercise undertaken as part of the University of Oxford - Artificial Intelligence: Cloud and Edge Implementations course as a learning challenge from Microsoft and Elephant Listening Project. The objective is to devise solutions for gunshot detection in tropical African forests and to create instant alerts to curtail poaching attempts.
